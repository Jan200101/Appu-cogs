# Appu-cogs

[![Current Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jan200101/Appu-cogs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Jan200101/Appu-cogs)

This is [Sentry](https://github.com/Jan200101)'s port of the now defunked Explosive-Cogs, his cog repo for the [Red-Discordbot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot).
Sentry deemed it too much of a secruity risk to leave unpolished code open for everyone to install as Red features a easy to use downloader.
